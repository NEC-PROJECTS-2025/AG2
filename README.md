This paper explores the use of MobileNetV2 with transfer learning for automated fruit classification and grading, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.
The model enables real-time assessments in agriculture, reducing human error and supporting decision-making.

The dual problem of classification and grading of fruits, a very important aspect in agricultural automation, is seldom pursued in
the sphere of personal computer vision. Though several works are per
formed based on features regarding size, shape, and color using CNNs
for classification, the current work will be based on transfer learning to
 avail models pre-trained on deep learning. This work classifies six cate
gories of fruits, namely banana, apple, orange, pomegranate, lime, and
 guava, using the FruitNet Indian Fruits dataset comprising 19,400 images
 by implementing various architectures like MobileNetV2, EfficientNetV2,
 NASNet, DenseNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, and Xception. It is observed
 that pre-processing increased the model performance for classification
 and grading by a huge margin to enable MobileNetV2 to go as high as
 99.7% accuracy. In this paper, a discussion will be made on the possi
bility of applying MobileNetV2 in fruit classification and improvement
 towards developing agricultural automation.
